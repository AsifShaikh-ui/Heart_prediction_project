💓Heart Stroke Prediction💓

It uses a Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model to make predictions based on input data.
The model is trained using real-world datasets and is integrated with a simple Streamlit UI to display the prediction results in an interactive way.

🔍 Objective
The main goal of this project is to understand how machine learning models, especially Logistic Regression, can be trained, saved, and used in real-time applications through a user interface.

⚙️ Working Process
The dataset is preprocessed and trained using Logistic Regression.
The trained model is saved as a .pkl file using joblib or pickle.
The saved model is loaded in a Python Streamlit app.
The user provides input values through the web interface.
The model predicts and displays the result instantly.

🧩 Tools and Technologies
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Streamlit
Pickle / Joblib

📊 Outcome
This project demonstrates how a machine learning model can be built, trained, and deployed with a user-friendly interface.
It also shows how Logistic Regression can be applied for binary classification problems such as prediction or decision-based outputs.
